
   About the Oracle MySQL Connector/Net 6.6.5 libray
   with file mysql.data.dll (392 704 bytes)

   (File mysql.data.dll originally resided here. But it is wanted
physically in project folder to /trunk/querypony/QueryPonyGui/libs/.
To avoid needless sources-zip-file inflation, it was not copied
there but moved.)

   File mysql.data.dll is one file from the Oracle MySQL
Connector/Net 6.6.5 libray.

   We utilize file v2/mysql.data.dll, extracted from
   - file mysql-connector-net-6.6.5-noinstall.zip
   - on http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net
   The sources for those binaries:
   - file mysql-connector-net-6.6.5-src.zip
   - on http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net
   The files used in QueryPony were downloaded on 2013-June-10.
   [download 20130610°1411]

   QueryPony can be compiled with or without mysql.data.dll
   built in. The DLL will be only built in, if in the projects
   the conditional compilation symbol 'MYSQL20130619YES' is set.
