
   QueryPony is a Simple Generic Database Query Tool and API.

   With QueryPony, you can connect to various databases and list and view
   their tables (provided you have some basic SQL language knowledge).

   QueryPony runs on Windows XP/SP3 .NET 3.5. It should also run on the
   higher Windows flavours, but this is not tested yet.

   Version QueryPony 0.3.0 is the Alpha Release.

   Here some quick notes about the addressed databases:

   - MS-SQL      This should work.

   - MySQL       This should work.
                 But the connector for MySQL may not always be part of QueryPony.
                 If you have a QueryPony without that, please provide the file
                 v2/mysql.data.dll from mysql-connector-net-6.6.5-noinstall.zip
                 on your own mission in the same folder as QueryPony.exe,
                 then QueryPony will attempt to talk to it.

   - ODBC        This should work.
                 What exactly you can access via this connection depends on
                 what connections you have provided in your machines 'ODBC
                 Data Source Administrator'.

   - OleDb       This should work.
                 What exactly you can access via this connection depends on
                 which drivers are installed on your machine. During development,
                 I worked with a Paradox/BDE OleDb connecton.

   - Oracle      This should work.

   - PostgreSQL  This should work.
                 This feature should work independend on the drivers installed
                 on your machine.

   - SQLite      This should work.
                 This feature should work independend on the drivers installed
                 installed on your machine.

   - CouchDB     This can only list the databases on the given server, nothing
                 more yet. This shall become an experimental feature. CouchDB
                 is a NoSQL database and does not align smoothly with SQL databases.
