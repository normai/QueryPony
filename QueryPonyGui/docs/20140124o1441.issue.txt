   note : This is about ticket http://sourceforge.net/p/querypony/tickets/2
   title : Object Browser not shown
   text : The object browser does not show when connecting to SQL Server 7 systems.
      QueryEx Plus also has this issue - see attached video - not sure if it's a bug
      or protocol change.
   note :
   - Sorrily, for SQL Server 7.0, I have no opportunity to test.
   - The oldest version have available to me is SQL Server 9 aka 2007, that works.
   ref : http://sqlserverbuilds.blogspot.de (20140126°1111)
      This is about the various SQL Server versions.
   ref : http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa275613%28v=sql.80%29.aspx (20140126°1511)
      This is one MSDN page about the System.Data.SqlClient namespace. It tells,
      this namespaces should work with SQL Server 7 and later.
   ref : http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.data.sqlclient%28v=vs.90%29.aspx (20140126°1512)
      This is the MSDN System.Data.SqlClient page for .NET 3.5.
      The most interesting statement is this:
      ----------------------------
      Caution. ADO.NET 2.0 does not support Asynchronous commands over shared memory
      for SQL Server 2000 or lower. However, you can force TCP instead of shared
      memory. You can do that by prefixing tcp: to the server name in the connection
      string or you can use localhost.
      ----------------------------
   finding : Trying server address "tcp://localhost/SQLEXPRESS" yields
      error 20130717°1243 (screenshot 20140126°1522). The same happens
      with strings like "tcp:localhost\SQLEXPRESS".
   finding : Experiment using server address "tcp:localhost\SQLEXPRESS".
      The 'tcp:' prefix causes the connection under SQLEXPRESS
      to fail, although reference 20140126°1512 indicates it should work.
   note : About setting breakpoints:
      (1) breakpoint 20140126°1611 in ConnectForm.cs in seq 20130618°0351
      "_client = DbClientFactory.GetDbClient(csLib)" ...
      This line returns a proper looking client object, but perhaps that
      one already has some flaw
      *
      (2) breakpoint 20140126°1621 in ConnectForm.cs some lines below
      line "bool bSuccess = _client.Connect();"
      This line returns false, so here then it definitly failed, causing
      the error message a few lines below being displayes.
      *
      (3) breakpoint 20140126°1631 in DbClientFactory.cs
      This comes when stepping into line with breakpoint 20140126°1611.
      Just this breakpoint does not break in the normal development setup,
      it seems to be inside a library, and demands special measures to
      work as expected - project QueryPonyLib must not be precompiled in
      single-file-delivery mode, but use as a normal side-by-side library.
      *
   note : Breakpoints inside the QueryPonyLib project (e.g.  20140126°1631)
      will not work as expected. This is due to the particular project settings for
      the single-file-delivery (compare . do the following:
      - In VS in the Solution Explorer pane, locate project
         QueryPonyGui/References/QueryPonyLib and click or rightclick it.
      - Then, in the properties pane, you should see "Copy Local = False".
      - Set "Copy Local = True".
      - Now breakpoint(s) inside the QueryPonyLib project should work
         as expected.
      - The reason: The executed code is no more the precompiled DLL from
         QueryPonyGui/libs/QueryPonyLib.dll, but the code reached via the
         reference QueryPonyGui/References/QueryPonyLib.
