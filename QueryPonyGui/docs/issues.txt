   issue 20130828°1531 'restoring connections works only partially'
   title : Restoring connections on startup works only partially
   symptom : Restoring connections on startup via ConnStatus.Connected property
      works only partially. I cannot see the logic of this behaviour.
   location : Method MainForm() sequence 20130828°1524
   note : It looks like the identification of the connections, and/or the
      translation between the ConnSettingsGui and ConnSettingsLib is leaky.
      This were not astonishing, because this whole topic is quite a mess.
      The chaos starts with the naming of the treeview nodes and the
      connection tabpages, and continues to the identification of connections
      inside the ServerList.
   todo : [todo 20130828°1533] Collect the connection identifying sequences
      all over the code and try to make a simpler schema out of it. Here some
      first entries for such list:
      - line 20130620°1135 'find index' in ConnectForm.DoConnect()
      - method 20130623°1121 ConnectForm.findConnectionInConnectionCombobox()
      - method 20130623°1011 ConnectForm.getConnectionIdFromTabpage()
      - method 20130729°1531 MainTv.searchTreenodeByConnSettings()
      - method 20130703°0933 MainTv.searchCorrespondingQueryform()
      -
   workaround : None. Live with only some connections being restored.

   issue 20130819°0822 'InvokeEx() in IOBusProvider for WinForms'
   title : InvokeEx() with lambda expression not possible in WinForm class.
   symptom : The original lines from IOBusProvider.cs developed inside a WPF
      window, causes compiler error "The type 'QueryPonyGui.MainForm' cannot
      be used as type parameter 'T' in the generic type or method
     'IOBus.IOBus_ISynchronizeInvokeExtensions.InvokeEx<T>(T, System.Action<T>)'.
      There is no implicit reference conversion from 'QueryPonyGui.MainForm'

   location : Sequence 20121215°2112 in IOBusProvider.cs::webreaderguiWriteLineDelegateImplementation()

   issue 20130816°0601
   title : TreeView Tables node not actualized
   symptom : If on a database connection you create a new table e.g. with an SQL
      command 'CREATE TABLE `TMPTBL`', that table may be created successfully,
      but it is not shown under the Tables treeview node.
   note : This is perhaps a general feature missing like 'Actualize View'.
   workaround : Close the connection and connect newly.

   issue 20130812°1321 'start with exception OnConfigRemoved'
   title : Program starts with ConfigurationErrorsException exception after
      an OnConfigRemoved event and finishes.
   note : See screenshots 20130812°1322 through 20130812°1325
   note : I saw this exception first time ever. I think that before it happened,
      I manually renamed the path to the configuration file. The user will probably
      never face this issue. Nevertheless, it were nice, if the code were robust
      enough, not to start the program with a runtime exception, but pop a graceful
      and informative error message.
   note : This reminds me on another topic. After deleting the settings, the program
      mostly remembers the old settings anyway, although the old settings file is gone
      and a new one is created. Where does this information come from? This question
      seems to have to do with this issue.
   note : Curiously, the identical file downloaded from the SourceForge repository
      did run fine.
   note : Curiously, the identical file, when it had a QueryPony.exe.config beside
      it, run also fine (file 20130812°1326).
   workaround : Do not rename the settings path.
   solution : I have wrapped the very first Settings access in a try loop (sequence
       20130812°1331 in Program.cs. But that is not tested, because after inserting
       the sequence, the config path was different, and the issue gone (see details
       there in Program.cs).

   issue 20130811°0901 'No context menu'
   title : Context menu Edit items not always available
   symptoms : In some situations, the main menu items do work, but the corresponding context
      menu is not available. This is the opposite of issue 20130624°1011 'menu items gray'.

   issue 20130810°1901 'edit menu items fail'
   title : ToolStripMenuItem 'Edit' submenu items do not work
   symptoms : In many situations the Edit submenu items are correctly available,
      but just do not work. Interestingly, the corresponding context menu does work.
   note : This is the continuation of issue 20130624°1011 'menu items gray', which
      was solved 20130810°1621. The menu items are available now, but fail working.
   finding : (finding 20130810°1955) Debugging the Windows message pipe (see partial
      classes 20130810°1922 and 20130810°1931) did not yield much insight. The
      wanted messages WM_COPY, WM_CUT, WM_PASTE were just not trapped by the hook.
      Why not? Is the context menu on the Connect Form somehow a self-defined one?
      I give up for now.
   workaround : Use mouse rightclick context menu.

   issue 20130702°1502 'Best way to tag objects for interconnection'
   title : What were the best way to tag various objects for their interconnection?
   location : E.g. Method 20130618°0412 MainForm() line 20130724°0814.
   situation : Here we tag the TabPage with the ConnectionSettingsLib object,
      so a TreeNode with a database connection can find it's corresponding
      TabPage. But this is perhaps not the best solution. Considerations are:
      (1) We could also tag the QueryForm, not the TabPage. Or the both of them.
      (2) The TreeNode is tagged not with a ConnectionSettingsLib, but with a
      Server.Database object. It might be more handy, if the TabPages and the
      TreeNodes were tagged with the same types.
   status : For now, leave it as it grew. But if later any masterplan becomes
      apparent, then refactor.

   issue 20130624°1011 'menu items gray'
   title : Keyboard Shortcuts broken, e.g. CTRL-C grayed out
   symptoms : E.g. in an edit field, CTRL-V will not insert the clipboard content,
      but context menu Rightclick-Paste works. In some situations, the context menu
      works, but the corresponding main menu items are not active.
   descript :
   note : Mark involved lines with " //// (debug 20130810°1602 'menu items gray')"
   finding : (finding 20130810°1603)
     (1) A first method to inspect seems to be 20130604°0532 EnableControls().
     (2) On program start, the 'Copy' menu item runs through the same procedurs
          as the 'Undo' and 'SelectAll' menu items. But that are not grayed out.
     (3) Method 20130604°0425 EditManager.cs::EnableSubMenus() seems to play a
          key roll in the issue.
     (4) The culprit seems to be method 20130619°0511 EditManager.cs::GetActiveControl()
          which does not return the active control correctly.
   workaround : Use the mouse.
   solution : (solution 20130810°1621) (1) New algorithm 20130810°1622
      to detect the active control in EditManager.GetActiveControl() and
      (2) Additional control processed with sequence 20130810°1623 in
      EditManager.CanEdit().
      (3) Additional control processed with sequence 20130810°1624 in
      EditManager.CanEdit().
   status : Finished. (But continuation is issue 20130810°1901 'edit menu items fail'.)
   note : Possibly, solution 20130810°1621 is not finally finishing the topic,
      but just a partial solution. It solved the exact situation I was debugging now.
      Let's see what remained.
   note : In case of re-introducing the MDI feature, the issue has to be touched again.

   issue 20130616°1711 'TabControl DrawItem border missing black line'
   descript : Method tabcontrol_ServerTypes_DrawItem() works fine except one
      detail. The borders of the tab title area looks a bit 3D, means the left
      side of the selected tab is white instead a black line as seen when using
      the DrawMode = Normal. But I just didn't find out what that is and give
      up now. You can see the difference also in the designer when switching
      the DrawMode.

   issue 20130607°1311 'the connection InfoMessage event availability'
   subject : Sorrily, unlike all the other connections, SQLiteConnection seems not
      to have an InfoMessage event. So this line cannot be translated to SQLite:
      'con.InfoMessage += new OleDbInfoMessageEventHandler(con_InfoMessage);'
   location : SqliteDbClient.cs::GetDbConnection() and others
   note : MSDN tells, the event "Occurs when SQL Server returns a warning or
      informational message."
   note : But e.g. the Devart.Data.SQLite SQLiteConnection has an 'Error' event.
   question: What alternative error messaging system is possible?
   workaround : We just leave the line outcommented and see what will happen.
