   issue 20220804°0931 'StackOverflow while form creation'
   location : file 20130604°1911 QueryPonyGui/Program.cs
   problem : Inside new MainForm(args) StackOverflow occurres
   finding : It has to do with the exact calling order of library loading things
   finding : If reference QueryPonyLib is set 'CopyLocal = true' this works, if not then happens
      StackOverflow. This means, extracting the QueryPonyLib resource fails, or is wanted too early.

   issue 20200928°1321 'con.GetSchema() exception'
   symptom : exception "ERROR [HYC00] [Microsoft][ODBC Paradox Driver]Optional feature not implemented"
      in line 'tab = con.GetSchema("Columns", new string[] { null, ((OdbcNode)node)._owner, ((OdbcNode)node)._name });'
   location : file OdbcDbBrowser.cs method 20130604°0845 GetSubObjectHierarchy
   finding : "((OdbcNode)node)._owner" is an empty string. It it is null, then the line works.
   workaround : Set "((OdbcNode)node)._owner" null.
   note : I have no idea, what exactly the Paradox user shall be. I tried 'Joe',
           the name mentioned in the ODBC setup, but this does not work.

      this happens, that blank tokens shall be processed. Formerly this never was the
      case. Has it to do with issue 20200928°1321 'con.GetSchema() exception'?

      not provide such feature due to security concerns. So the Assembly.Load(bytes) will

   issue 20200522°1011 'IntegratedSecurity missing with Oracle'
   matter : Compiler-Warning ".. mismatch between the processor architecture .."
   finding : PS script http://www.trekta.biz/svn/demosps/trunk/scripts/tell-dotnet-framework-version.ps1
      [script 20200523°0111] tells framework versions, but not for e.g. System.Data.SQLite.dll.
   suspect : The warning says processor architecture, not framework version.
      It might have to do with the fact QueryPonyLib is build for 'Any CPU', not explicitly
      for 'x86'. I have not yet found out how to switch that to something other than 'Any CPU'.

   issue 20180820°0451 sharpdev tools 15.0 unrecognized
   matter : After projects have been edited with Visual Studio 2017,
 SharpDevelop 5.1 complains 'The tools version "15.0" is unrecognized'
   ref : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41666798/the-tools-version-15-0-is-unrecognized [20180820°0452]
   note : In 20180820°0452, Scott Chamberlain recommends, to manually edit
 the version number in the project file(s). This will be helpful for SharpDevelop,
 but I want a solution, where the both (VS and SD) work interchangably without
 manipulating the project files, and without an update procedure on each switch.
 Not sure, whether this is possible at all.

   note : The same table can be opened by Firefox SQLite Manager without problem,

   issue 20130828°1531 'restoring connections works only partially'
   title : Restoring connections on startup works only partially
   symptom : Restoring connections on startup via ConnStatus.Connected property
      works only partially. I cannot see the logic of this behaviour.
   location : Method MainForm() sequence 20130828°1524
   note : It looks like the identification of the connections, and/or the
      translation between the ConnSettingsGui and ConnSettingsLib is leaky.
      This were not astonishing, because this whole topic is quite a mess.
      The chaos starts with the naming of the treeview nodes and the
      connection tabpages, and continues to the identification of connections
      inside the ServerList.
   todo : [todo 20130828°1533] Collect the connection identifying sequences
      all over the code and try to make a simpler schema out of it. Here some
      first entries for such list:

   issue 20130812°1321 'start with exception OnConfigRemoved'
   title : Program starts with ConfigurationErrorsException exception after
      an OnConfigRemoved event and finishes.
   note : See screenshots 20130812°1322 through 20130812°1325
   note : I saw this exception first time ever. I think that before it happened,
      I manually renamed the path to the configuration file. The user will probably
      never face this issue. Nevertheless, it were nice, if the code were robust
      enough, not to start the program with a runtime exception, but pop a graceful
      and informative error message.
   note : This reminds me on another topic. After deleting the settings, the program
      mostly remembers the old settings anyway, although the old settings file is gone
      and a new one is created. Where does this information come from? This question
      seems to have to do with this issue.
   note : Curiously, the identical file downloaded from the SourceForge repository
      did run fine.
   note : Curiously, the identical file, when it had a QueryPony.exe.config beside
      it, run also fine (file 20130812°1326).
   workaround : Do not rename the settings path.
   solution : I have wrapped the very first Settings access in a try loop (seq
       20130812°1331 in Program.cs. But that is not tested, because after inserting
       the sequence, the config path was different, and the issue gone (see details
       there in Program.cs).

   note : This is the continuation of issue 20130624°1011 'menu items gray', which
      was solved 20130810°1621. The menu items are available now, but fail working.
   finding : (finding 20130810°1955) Debugging the Windows message pipe (see partial
      classes 20130810°1922 and 20130810°1931) did not yield much insight. The
      wanted messages WM_COPY, WM_CUT, WM_PASTE were just not trapped by the hook.
      Why not? Is the context menu on the Connect Form somehow a self-defined one?
      I give up for now.

   situation : Here we tag the TabPage with the ConnectionSettingsLib object,
      so a TreeNode with a database connection can find it's corresponding
      TabPage. But this is perhaps not the best solution. Considerations are:
      (1) We could also tag the QueryForm, not the TabPage. Or the both of them.
      (2) The TreeNode is tagged not with a ConnectionSettingsLib, but with a
      Server.Database object. It might be more handy, if the TabPages and the
      TreeNodes were tagged with the same types.

     (1) A first method to inspect seems to be 20130604°0532 EnableControls().
     (2) On program start, the 'Copy' menu item runs through the same procedurs
          as the 'Undo' and 'SelectAll' menu items. But that are not grayed out.
     (3) Method 20130604°0425 EditManager.cs::EnableSubMenus() seems to play a
          key roll in the issue.

          which does not return the active control correctly.
   workaround : Use the mouse.
   solution : (solution 20130810°1621) (1) New algorithm 20130810°1622
